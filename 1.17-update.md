## About 1.17 rendering changes and this mod

Minecraft 1.17 brought some interesting features, changes in the entity models.  
I don't (yet) know what do they want to do, probably a multithreaded rendering,  
but it is not implemented yet...  

bendy-lib won't change its model logic now, I want to see what do Mojang going to do.
I'll change some critical things to work with the new logic, but I won't do any thread optimisations...
