## About 1.17 rendering changes and this mod

### model part swapping current state
The current swap mechanic will probably change completely, also it will solve other compatibility issues  
At the time, I write this, I don't know how will it work, if you want to use this library, feel free to contact me on Discord.  
As soon as I find a good way to inject custom cuboids I'll post the technique.


Minecraft 1.17 brought some interesting features, changes in the entity models.  
I don't (yet) know what do they want to do, probably a multithreaded rendering,  
but it is not implemented yet...  

bendy-lib won't change its model logic now, I want to see what do Mojang going to do.
I'll change some critical things to work with the new logic, but I won't do any thread optimisations...
